def uni_cleaner():
    """
        Cleans up common temporary files from the user's Downloads folder.

        This function performs the following actions:
        - Identifies and deletes all `.rdp`, `.ica`, and `.crdownload` files in the Downloads directory.
        - Works cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux) by dynamically resolving the user's home directory.
        - Logs any errors that occur during the process to `/tmp/error_log.txt` with a timestamp and traceback.

        This is intended for use in automated cleanup scripts on systems where temporary
        remote session or browser files may accumulate in the Downloads folder.

        Returns:
            None
